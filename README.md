# Density-Ratio-Based-Proxy-Causal-Learning-without-Density-Ratios

This GitHub repository includes the implementation code of the paper "Density Ratio-based Proxy Causal Learning Without Density Ratios" (Accepted to AISTATS 2025). All the codes are written in Python 3 and we utilized JaX library to accelarate the implementation with GPU. Nevertheless, all the experiments can be run with CPU version of JaX library. In this paper, we address the setting of Proxy Causal Learning (PCL) with a treatment bridge function to estimate the causal effect functions dose response and conditional dose response curves.

 ## Proxy Causal Inference Directed Acyclic Graph

 The following figure illustrates an instance of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for the PCL setting. In this graph, the gray circles denote the observed variables: $A$ denotes the treatment, $Y$ denotes the outcome, $Z$ denotes the treatment proxy, and $W$ denotes the outcome proxy. The white circle denotes the unobserved confounding variable $U$. Bi-directional dotted arrows indicate that either direction in the DAG is possible, or that both variables may share a common ancestor.

 ## Simulations In the Paper

All the simulation codes for the paper manuscript are included inside the folder "Simulations". The subfolders are named accordingly, e.g., "Simularions/ATE_Simulations/dSpriteExperiment" folder contains the experiments for the dSprite experiments in the paper (Figure (2-b)). The jupyter notebooks inside the folder "Simulations/AnalyzeSimulationResults" illustrate the plots presented in the paper. For example, the jupyter notebook "Simulations/AnalyzeSimulationResults/Plot_ATE_dSprite_Simulation_ComplexityRegularized.ipynb" includes the plot in Figure (2-b). In order to run this notebook, you need to first run the python simulation scripts inside the folder "Simularions/ATE_Simulations/dSpriteExperiment" that will create the pickle files which stores the numerical experiment results. Below, we share the process to reproduce Figure (2-a). The others follow similarly.

* Run all the python scripts in the folder "Simulations/ATE_Simulations/SyntheticLowDim" with the following commands:
     ``` python AlternativeProxyKernel_SyntheticDataExperiment1.py```
      ``` python KernelNegativeControl_SyntheticDataExperiment1.py```
      ``` python KPV_SyntheticDataExperiment1_V2.py```
      ``` python PKIPW_SyntheticDataExperiment1.py```
      ``` python PMMR_SyntheticDataExperiment1_V2.py```

* After the simulations are done, these scripts will generate the following pickle files that contains the results:
  * "Simulations/Results/Kernel_Alternative_Proxy_Synthetic_Experiment1.pkl"
  * "Simulations/Results/Kernel_Negative_Control_Synthetic_Experiment1.pkl"
  * "Simulations/Results/KPV_Synthetic_Experiment1_V2.pkl"
  * "Simulations/Results/PKIPW_Synthetic_Experiment1.pkl"
  * "Simulations/Results/PMMR_Synthetic_Experiment1_V2.pkl"
 
* The jupyter notebook "Simulations/AnalyzeSimulationResultsFinal/Plot_ATE_SyntheticLowDim_Simulation_ComplexityRegularized.ipynb" reads the above pickle files and visualize the results.
